***What the Code Does***:

    Create Label Map: The code generates a label map file (label_map.pbtxt) containing labels for the classes I'll be detecting (e.g., Mask and NoMask).

    Generate TFRecords: It runs the generate_tfrecord.py script to convert images and annotations into TFRecord format, which is the standard input format for TensorFlow's object detection models.

    Download Pre-trained Model: It clones the TensorFlow models repository and prepares to use the SSD MobileNet V2 model for object detection. This model is already trained, so I won't need to train from scratch. But I still update the pipeline with my own code to make it work for my specific project.

    Configure Model for Transfer Learning: The code updates the pipeline configuration file (pipeline.config) to specify the number of classes and paths for the training data. This allows me to fine-tune the pre-trained model on my specific classes.

    Load and Restore the Model: It loads the model from the checkpoint, enabling me to use the trained weights for inference without retraining.

    Real-Time Detection: The code sets up a webcam feed to capture frames and performs real-time detection using the model. It displays the results with bounding boxes and labels on the video feed.
